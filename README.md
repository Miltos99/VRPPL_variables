# Vehicle Routing Problem with Pickup and Loading (VRPPL)  with the use of drone Solution

## Overview
This project presents a sophisticated solution to the Vehicle and drone Routing Problem with Pickup and Loading (VRPPL) using the Pulp library and the Gurobi optimizer. The objective is to optimize the distribution of packages across various nodes, efficiently planning routes for a fleet of vehicles with the combination of a drone. Our approach not only minimizes travel cost and time but also respects loading constraints, ensuring a realistic and practical application.

By integrating cutting-edge operations research techniques and powerful optimization tools, the model strategically addresses the complexities involved in real-world logistics and distribution systems. This project serves as a valuable resource for anyone looking to understand or improve upon route optimization and logistics planning.
