This project presents a sophisticated solution to the Vehicle Routing Problem with Pickup and Loading (VRPPL) using the Pulp library and the Gurobi optimizer.
The objective is to optimize the distribution of packages across various nodes, efficiently planning routes for a fleet of vehicles that not only minimizes 
travel cost and time but also respects loading constraints.By integrating cutting-edge operations research techniques and powerful optimization tools,
the model strategically addresses the complexities involved in real-world logistics and distribution systems.The project serves as a valuable resource for anyone
looking to understand or improve upon route optimization and logistics planning
